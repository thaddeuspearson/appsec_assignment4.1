## Part 2.1 What's the difference?


    1. What are the two types of intents?

        The two types of intents are `implicit` and `explicit`. 
        
        Implicit intents do not specify the the component(s) that should be called, but rather specifies the 
        action to be performed. The classic example of an implicit intent is a hyperlink.

        Explicit intents do specify the components that should be called. This limits the action to only the 
        component that is specified in the invocation


    2. Which of the two types of Intents is (generally) more secure?

        Since the components are limited to only the ones specified in the invocation, explicit intents are 
        generally more secure that implicit intents.


    3. What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?

        The type of intent shown is an implicit intent:

            ```
            var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
            intent.type = "text/giftcards_browse"
            intent.data = Uri.parse("https://appsec.moyix.net/api/index")
            intent.putExtra("User", loggedInUser);
            startActivity(intent)
            ``` 

        The use of `.ACTION_VIEW`, and gathering the necessary data from a `Uri.parse` call (hyperlink) is a 
        classic example of an implicent intent.


    4. What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?

        The type of intent shown is an explicit intent:

            ```
            var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
            intent.putExtra("User", loggedInUser);
            startActivity(intent)
            ```

        `ProductScrollingActivity::class.java` is the external class that is to be invoked in this intent.


    5. Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?

        The proper way (or more secure way) to do an intent is through the use of an explicit intent.
        To fix the incorrect intent, I simply replaced:

            ```
            var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)
            intent.type = "text/giftcards_browse"
            intent.data = Uri.parse("https://appsec.moyix.net/api/index")
            ```

        with:

            ```
            var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
            ```

        as ProductScrollingActivity explicitly sets the date and type within the intent-filter itself:

            ```
            <data android:mimeType="text/giftcards_browse" />
            <data android:scheme="giftcard" />
            <data android:host="appsec.moyix.net"/>
            ```

        Since the intent is now explicitly set, the concern of loading data from a potentially compromised 
        hyperlink has been mitigated.

## Part 2.2 Shutting out the world

    In order to limit the possibility of other applications using Intents to launch activities of our 
    application, I added the following `uses-permission` entry to AndroidManifest.xml:

        ```
        <permission android:name="GiftCardSite.permission" android.protectionLevel="signature"/>
        ```
