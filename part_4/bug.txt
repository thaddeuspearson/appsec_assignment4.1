## The Vulnerability

    The vulnerability that exists in the REST API within the `CardInterface.kt` file:

        ```
        @PUT("/api/use/{card_number}")
        fun useCard(@Path("card_number") card_number: Int?, @Header("Authorization") authHeader: String): Call<Card?>
        ```

    the `card_number` parameter that is passed into the `useCard` function is how the giftcard that is 
    going to be used is determined. If a malicious actor were to get (or guess) the card number of a
    giftcard that did not belong to them, and pass that number to the api/use/ endpoint with a PUT 
    request, the malicious actor would be able to use a card that does not belong to them.


## The Fix

    The way to fix this issue is to pass along an authorization token along with the request. On the
    server side, an authorization check can be made with that token, double checking that the request to 
    use the specifed card (which is associated with a user id) matches the user id associated with the
    authorization token. Any fraudulent request not matching would simply be denied.
